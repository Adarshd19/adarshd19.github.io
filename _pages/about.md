Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the [Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/ph-d-programs/applied-and-interdisciplinary-mathematics--aim-.html) program at the University of Michigan. I am co-advised by [Laura Balzano](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Martin Strauss](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/).

My research is broadly in machine learning. In particular, I am interested in both preference learning and algorithmic fairness. On the preference learning side, I am currently thinking about how to better model human preferences by taking into account intransitivities. On the algorithmic fairness side, I am currently thinking about the effects of imposing fairness constraints in a dynamic system.
