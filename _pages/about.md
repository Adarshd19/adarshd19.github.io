Hi! I am a Research Assistant in the Indian Institute of Science. I am working with [Dr. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/) on various projects related to Medical Image Analysis.

My research is broadly in Image Processing and Deep learning. I am interested in Compressive sensing, Optimization problems in Image & Signal Processing, Computational Imaging, Computer Vision, Image Restoration algorithms apart from a whole host of other Signal Processing sub-domains. 

I did my undergraduate in Electrical & Electronics Engineering with a Minor Specialization in Signal Processing & Control at Manipal Institute of Technology.
