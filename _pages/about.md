Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the [Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/ph-d-programs/applied-and-interdisciplinary-mathematics--aim-.html) program at the University of Michigan. My co-advisors are [Laura Balzano](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~girasole/) and [Martin Strauss](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~martinjs/).

My research is broadly in machine learning. In particular, I am interested in both preference learning and algorithmic fairness. My goal is to build theoretically sound machine learning algorithms that also work practically.
