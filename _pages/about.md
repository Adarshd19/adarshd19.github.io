Hi! I am a Research Assistant in the Indian Institute of Science. I am working with Dr. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula on various projects related to Medical Image Analysis.

My research is broadly in Image Processing and Deep learning. I am interested in Computational Imaging, Computer Vision, Image Restoration algorithms apart from a whole host of other Signal Processing sub-domains.
